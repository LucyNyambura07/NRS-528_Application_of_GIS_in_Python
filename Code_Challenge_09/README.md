# Insights of this Code Challenge
The script uses ArcPy.da module to automate data processing on a shapefile of invasive species, focusing on records with and without photos. 

It sets a workspace to avoid full path specifications and defines the dataset and relevant fields for photos and species.

The script generates two new datasets: **1.** One for records with photos **2.** Another for those without. 

These are saved as shapefiles in a new folder(Results).

Not forgetting it confirms the generation of new shapefiles.
