# Insights of this Code Challenge
## Code 1 (Describing the shapefile)
The code describes the properties of the shapefile and calculates its extent.
It inputs the path of the input shapefile and returns a tuple containing the shape type, spatial reference name, spatial reference type and the extent.

It later prints the information about the shapefile. That is, the shape type, spatial reference name, spatial reference type and extent of the shapefile.
    
 ## Code 2 (Converting KML to Layer)
